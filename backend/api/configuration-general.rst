The following general configuration options can be changed via `Resources/config/oro/app.yml` in any bundle
or `config/config.yml` of your application.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    oro_api:

        # The prefix of REST API URLs.
        # The default value is "/api/".
        rest_api_prefix: '/api/'

        # The regular expression pattern to which REST API URLs are matched.
        # The default value is "^/api/(?!(rest|doc)($|/.*))".
        rest_api_pattern: '^/api/(?!(rest|doc)($|/.*))'

        # The default page size. It is used when the page size is not specified in a request explicitly.
        # The default value is 10.
        default_page_size: 10

        # The maximum number of primary entities that can be retrieved by a request.
        # The default value is -1 that means unlimited.
        max_entities: -1

        # The maximum number of related entities that can be retrieved by a request.
        # The default value is 100.
        max_related_entities: 100

        # The maximum number of entities that can be deleted by one request.
        # The default value is 100.
        max_delete_entities: 100

To change the maximum number of entities that can be retrieved by a request for a specific API resource
use the ``max_result`` option in `Resources/config/oro/api.yml`. For details see
:ref:`entities <entities-config>` and :ref:`actions <actions-config>` configuration sections.

Also see :ref:`How To <max-number-of-entities-to-be-deleted>` to learn how to change the maximum number of entities
that can be deleted by one request for a specific API resource.
